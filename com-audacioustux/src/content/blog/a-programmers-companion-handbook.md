- how should I maintain my grade and learn out of curriculum in parallel?

- I want to be a software engineer but I have recently learned that salary is much lower these days in general and the market situation is bad.
But there are few companies that still provide good pay. How can I prepare to be fitted in those companies?

- how should I get connected with you so that I can drop further questions to you?

- It's my 3rd year, I want to get a good start in my career, how should I look for the right internship?

- My friend told me if I am not good at coding, I should choose Quality Assurance.
Can you please tell what a Quality Assurance Engineer does?
And they really don't need coding?
Additionally someone said something about unit test or something like that, and they told me it's a task of a developer not tester. I am confused.

- You have mentioned "DevOps" in your post, what is that?
Can you please tell what a DevOps engineer does as day to day work?

- I have a few advance courses which I can choose from, but I am not sure which one I should pick.
Can you please tell me how I should learn about a course before getting enrolled?

- My friend told me backend is much better than frontend, but I heard there's some cool stuff like web workers. I don't really much know.
Can you please give me a clear idea of the themes of Backend and frontend engineering? Is really one better than the other?

- what it takes to be a good software engineer?

- I have focused on core computer science for some time, and now I want to prepare myself for the technologies and the ecosystem around the position I want to work in future. Should I join internship ahead of my university course?
And should I do multiple internship?

- how to break down a problem in different segments to better understand what's happening?

- as a first-year, should I focus on new and shiny technologies and learn them?
or should I first get the fundamentals?

- how should I learn something new?

- If someone has passion, Is it worth it for them to pursue a CS degree or should they just become a self taught engineer?

- how do I get help about something from other people who possibly have worked on that before?
how do I get to know such people?

- I heard some terms like big data, ml, and I think I really want to start a career in data analytics.
Can you please tell what are the positions around these ecosystems and how should I prepare?

- If someone has passion, Is it worth it for them to pursue a CS degree or should they just become a self taught engineer?
