## My Interests

Different fields of study, school of thoughts, disciplines are hard to precisely generalize and catagorize into a few words. They're all inter-connected in a very complex dynamic way. But accepting the limitations of language, I'll start with:

- _**Philosophy**_: I started my journey in this realm with the [Philosophize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast) Podcasts. It helped me to resolve some of my dilemmas, and gave me new perspectives to look at the world.
- _**Systems Science**_: It's a very broad field. But even having a crumbs of knowledge about it can help understand the world better. It's a very powerful tool to analyze complex systems, and it's a very useful skill to have for software engineer like me.
- _**Psychology**_: I'm not a psychologist, but I think it's a very important field of study. It helps us understand ourselves, and others better. It helps us to be more empathetic, and to be a better person.
- _**Physics**_: This kinda relates to my interest in Systems Science, as software systems are just simulation of the real world, and the laws of physics are as fundamental as it gets in case of e.g., distributed systems.
- _**Biology**_: Biological systems are one of the most complex systems we know of. It's a great analogy to use and get inspirations from when designing software systems. Many fundamental concepts, ideas and algorithms in Computer Science are inspired from Biology, including Object-Oriented Programming, Neuromorphic Computing, Genetic Algorithms - to name a few.
- _**Computer Science**_: I'm a Software Engineer and Researcher, so this is kinda obvious. I've been learning programming since I was 14, and I've been working as a professional R&D engineer since 2020. As of 2023, my primary focus is on Distributed Systems, Scalability and Security.

## Theological Views

Well, put simply, I'm an athiest. People might have different definitons and connotations of atheism, so lemme narrow that down a bit - I simply don't believe in any Gods existence, neither do I claim God doesn't exist. [Athiesm is NOT a religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIXGRoPr8a4). To me, "God" is a label used to describe the yet unknown and unexplained, kindof like the way use had used the term "aether" to describe the medium through which light travelled before we discovered the electromagnetic spectrum. But again, there're different definitions of God, and Atheism, so I'll just say I'm an agnostic athiest - to be a bit more precise.

## Idiological Views

Ideologies are not binary - they're spectrums. No, I'm not fan of [Political Compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum), Although I think those serve pragmatic purposes, the precision of it is questionable, as there're far more axioms to consider than can be put on a chart. The axiomatization itself is a very complex task. Also, idologies are not static, words change their meaning over time, people tends to have inconsistent views, over-simplify or generalize things, and so on. So, I'll just list some of my views without going into the details, and you can decide for yourself what I am.

- I believe in the freedom of speech, and expression. Unless it's a direct threat to someone's life, I don't think it should be censored.
- I support LGBTQIA+ individuals, their rights, and social reforms are necessary to ensure fairness for everyone.
- Feminism is not only about female rights, it's about fairness for everyone. Do we need a better term? Maybe, but that's a different discussion. I support feminism.
- Free market is a good thing, but it's not perfect. It needs to be monitored and regulated to ensure fairness. With the technological advancements, I think we can do better.
- Evolution is a fact, and it's a very beautiful process. I don't think it's a good idea to teach creationism in schools.
- Things are complex. Critical thinking should be the base of all our decisions, including doing seemingly good things. We should train our [Fast and Slow Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) to be more rational, and aim to find better truths.

## Activities

- _**Mentoring**_: It's like forming a virtual brain, where individual people acts like different parts of the brain, and the collective intelligence is the emergent property of the system. I've been mentoring people for a while now, and I think it's a great way to learn and grow.
- _**Writing**_: I write about my thoughts, ideas, and experiences. I think it's a great way to organize my thoughts, and identify the contradictions and inconsistencies in my views. I also write about my projects, and the things I learn.
- _**Reading / Listening**_: I try to read as much as I can. Mostly technical and non-fiction books, but also fiction sometimes. Probably the half of the books that i've read are in form of audiobooks, and technical books as PDFs or EPUBs. I also listen to podcasts a lot.
