> It's DRAFT!

I think we take our mindset for granted. We point our finger at people and question their beliefs, actions, and decisions... "Why don't do this? Why don't you do that? Why don't you think like this? Why don't you think like that?" - We tend to scrutinize the actions and beliefs of others more intensely than we do our own. This can be tied to a variety of psychological tendencies, such as the self-serving bias, which is the tendency to see oneself in a more favorable light, or the fundamental attribution error, where one attributes others' actions to their character rather than to situational factors, while giving oneself more leeway due to circumstance.

The book [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow) by Daniel Kahneman is a great read on this topic.

But, before going more philosophical - Is this a typical "Self-Development" article, with some pretty obvious facts and made up stories?

Well... ummm... yes, but...  
No, there's no punchline.

Let me give you an analogy instead - suppose you want to improve your communication skills. I'd highly recommend you to talk to people... But that sounds so naive, right? What if I recommended some books on communication skills? Or some online courses? Or some YouTube videos? Or some podcasts? Or some blogs? Or some... and you end up with a list of 100+ resources, and you don't know where to start.

You know what could be a better approach? Neither do I... no, there's no punchline here either. What else could I help you with? You could ask your question to ChatGPT and get maybe even better response. But what I've learned by now is - It's not only the resources that matter, but also the mindset. And that mindset is something we should strive to develop.

But... wait a minute... it's not like I can just sit down, and think about stuffs all day long, and develop a mindset. Neither it makes sense to read a book on mindset... I mean, you'd need a mindset to read a book on mindset, right? So, how do I break this circular dependency?  

Let's start with a simple question - What is a mindset?

> A mindset is an established set of attitudes of a person or group concerning culture, values, philosophy, frame of mind, outlook, and disposition. It may also arise from a person's worldview or beliefs about the meaning of life. A person can have multiple mindsets, whilst the two most common ones are often cited as the growth and fixed mindset, a person also has a money mindset which can be more deeply described as a poverty mindset or a wealth mindset. There are also: abundance mindset, positive mindset, negative mindset, victim mindset, protector mindset, poverty mindset, rich mindset, wealth mindset, losing mindset, and winning mindset among others that form the make up of a person's overall mindset based on the various values, beliefs, experiences and opinions that comprise the thinking on a conscious and unconscious level regarding these things.
>
> A mindset could create an incentive to adopt (or accept) previous behaviors, choices, or tools, sometimes known as cognitive inertia or groupthink. When a prevailing mindset is limiting or inappropriate, it may be difficult to counteract the grip of mindset on analysis and decision-making.
>
> In cognitive psychology, a mindset is the cognitive process activated in a task.
>
> A mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notations held by one or more people or groups of people. A mindset can also be seen as arising out of a person's world view or philosophy of life.

Yah, such ingenuity to copy-paste from Wikipedia. But I think it's a good definition to start with.

## QnA - List of questions I've been asked

- how should I maintain my grade and learn out of curriculum in parallel?

- I want to be a software engineer but I have recently learned that salary is much lower these days in general and the market situation is bad.
  But there are few companies that still provide good pay. How can I prepare to be fitted in those companies?

- how should I get connected with you so that I can drop further questions to you?

- It's my 3rd year, I want to get a good start in my career, how should I look for the right internship?

- My friend told me if I am not good at coding, I should choose Quality Assurance.
  Can you please tell what a Quality Assurance Engineer does?
  And they really don't need coding?
  Additionally someone said something about unit test or something like that, and they told me it's a task of a developer not tester. I am confused.

- You have mentioned "DevOps" in your post, what is that?
  Can you please tell what a DevOps engineer does as day to day work?

- I have a few advance courses which I can choose from, but I am not sure which one I should pick.
  Can you please tell me how I should learn about a course before getting enrolled?

- My friend told me backend is much better than frontend, but I heard there's some cool stuff like web workers. I don't really much know.
  Can you please give me a clear idea of the themes of Backend and frontend engineering? Is really one better than the other?

- what it takes to be a good software engineer?

- I have focused on core computer science for some time, and now I want to prepare myself for the technologies and the ecosystem around the position I want to work in future. Should I join internship ahead of my university course?
  And should I do multiple internship?

- how to break down a problem in different segments to better understand what's happening?

- as a first-year, should I focus on new and shiny technologies and learn them?
  or should I first get the fundamentals?

- how should I learn something new?

- If someone has passion, Is it worth it for them to pursue a CS degree or should they just become a self taught engineer?

- how do I get help about something from other people who possibly have worked on that before?
  how do I get to know such people?

- I heard some terms like big data, ml, and I think I really want to start a career in data analytics.
  Can you please tell what are the positions around these ecosystems and how should I prepare?

- If someone has passion, Is it worth it for them to pursue a CS degree or should they just become a self taught engineer?
