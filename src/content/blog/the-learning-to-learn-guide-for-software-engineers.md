## Context

I've been learning programming since 2012 from my high school days. But my journey started in a very passive way. I mean, it was not in my academic curriculum, wasn't a career path I was aware of, and I didn't have any mentor to guide me. I was just a curious kid who used to spend a lot of time on the computer for 6 years by then and recently got exposed to the internet. I had lost all my interest in academics, results were getting worse... But, Programming was something that I found interesting. I could instantly see a few real-life use cases of my HTML, CSS, and PHP knowledge, and I could learn things on my own without any external help. There was no Competition or Comparison with others. I was just doing it for fun.., or maybe because that was the only thing I could do at that time and got some recognition for it.

So learning programming was not an active goal for me in the beginning, nor something I had a clear idea about before I got exposed to it. But it's far more likely that whoever ever reading this text is already determined to learn programming, and knows about the career path and the opportunities it brings. So, I'm not going to talk about the motivation part of learning programming. I'm going to talk about the learning part, and how to learn programming in particular.

I've tried to help many on their journey of learning programming, and seen some common patterns in the way people struggle, get stuck, and in some cases, give up. But I also face problems when I try to think of the right plan for them. People have different values and priorities in their lives, and prejudices about the world, So, it's very hard to give a general roadmap or guideline. It's harder for me particularly because I care more about learning and experimenting with things, that may not have any direct impact on my career or have any monetary value.  
But the thing is, I do have goals, and whatever I do, I try to align it with those goals and have some leeway to get exposed to new things. So, I think the common ground among all of us is that we want to learn, and some common mindset and principles can help us learn better. I'll try to share some of those, that I've found useful in my journey and that I believe are required to bootstrap your learning process.

## QnA - List of questions I've been asked

- how should I maintain my grade and learn out of curriculum in parallel?

- I want to be a software engineer but I have recently learned that salary is much lower these days in general and the market situation is bad.
  But there are few companies that still provide good pay. How can I prepare to be fitted in those companies?

- how should I get connected with you so that I can drop further questions to you?

- It's my 3rd year, I want to get a good start in my career, how should I look for the right internship?

- My friend told me if I am not good at coding, I should choose Quality Assurance.
  Can you please tell what a Quality Assurance Engineer does?
  And they really don't need coding?
  Additionally someone said something about unit test or something like that, and they told me it's a task of a developer not tester. I am confused.

- You have mentioned "DevOps" in your post, what is that?
  Can you please tell what a DevOps engineer does as day to day work?

- I have a few advance courses which I can choose from, but I am not sure which one I should pick.
  Can you please tell me how I should learn about a course before getting enrolled?

- My friend told me backend is much better than frontend, but I heard there's some cool stuff like web workers. I don't really much know.
  Can you please give me a clear idea of the themes of Backend and frontend engineering? Is really one better than the other?

- what it takes to be a good software engineer?

- I have focused on core computer science for some time, and now I want to prepare myself for the technologies and the ecosystem around the position I want to work in future. Should I join internship ahead of my university course?
  And should I do multiple internship?

- how to break down a problem in different segments to better understand what's happening?

- as a first-year, should I focus on new and shiny technologies and learn them?
  or should I first get the fundamentals?

- how should I learn something new?

- If someone has passion, Is it worth it for them to pursue a CS degree or should they just become a self taught engineer?

- how do I get help about something from other people who possibly have worked on that before?
  how do I get to know such people?

- I heard some terms like big data, ml, and I think I really want to start a career in data analytics.
  Can you please tell what are the positions around these ecosystems and how should I prepare?

- If someone has passion, Is it worth it for them to pursue a CS degree or should they just become a self taught engineer?
